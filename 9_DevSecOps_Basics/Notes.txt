Sure! Here's a structured outline for your DevSecOps Fundamentals session, including hands-on demos:

### 1. Introduction to DevSecOps
**DevSecOps** stands for Development, Security, and Operations. It is an approach that integrates security practices within the DevOps process. The goal is to ensure that security is a shared responsibility across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), from development to deployment and maintenance. This approach helps in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the risk of security breaches.

### 2. Introduction to SAST, DAST, and SCA
**Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: SAST tools analyze source code for vulnerabilities without executing the code. They are typically used early in the SDLC to catch issues during the coding phase.

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: DAST tools test running applications for vulnerabilities by simulating attacks from the outside. They are used later in the SDLC to identify issues that might not be caught by SAST.

**Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: SCA tools analyze open-source components and libraries used in the application to identify known vulnerabilities and licensing issues. They help ensure that third-party components do not introduce security risks.

  - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000` to access the SonarQube dashboard. Default credentials are `admin/admin`.

**2. Configure Jenkins Integration:**
- **Install SonarQube Scanner Plugin**:
  - In Jenkins, go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
  - Search for "SonarQube Scanner" and install it without restarting Jenkins.
- **Configure SonarQube in Jenkins**:
  - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.
  - Scroll down to **SonarQube servers** and click on **Add SonarQube**.
  - Provide a name for your SonarQube instance and the server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:9000`).
  - Add the SonarQube authentication token you generated from the SonarQube dashboard.

**3. Pipeline Configuration and Analysis:**
- **Create a Pipeline Job**:
  - In Jenkins, create a new item and select **Pipeline**.
- **Pipeline Script**:
  - Add the following pipeline script to run a SonarQube scan:
    ```groovy
    pipeline {
        agent any
        stages {
            stage('Checkout') {
                steps {
                    checkout scm
                }
            }
            stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
                environment {
                    scannerHome = tool 'SonarQube Scanner'
                }
                steps {
                    withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube') {
                        sh "${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner"
                    }
                }
            }
