exit status quiz

1.All commands, including shell scripts, return an exit status.
true
Every Linux command returns an exit status in the form of an integer number, regardless if the command executed was a precompiled binary program or a shell script.


2.Given the following options, which are the most comprehensive and valid Linux command exit statuses?
ans: Exit statuses are integers that fall between 0 and 255. An exit status of zero (0) indicates success. A non-zero (1-255) exit status indicates failure.

3.Which special variable contains the value of the exit status of the previously executed command?
ans: $?

example: mkdir dir1
echo $?

4.What symbol means "AND"?
ans: &&

5.What symbol means "OR"?
ans: ||

6.In the following example, if the mkdir command fails, the cp command will be executed.
mkdir /tmp/bak && cp test.txt /tmp/bak/
ans: false

7.True or False. A command following a semicolon will be executed no matter the exit status of the command that preceded the semicolon.
ans: true
When commands are separated by a semicolon (;), they are executed in order, regardless of the exit status of the previous command(s). A command that follows a double ampersand (&&) will only execute if the exit status of the command preceding the double ampersands is non-zero.

8. What is the exit status of the following shell script?
#!/bin/bash 
hostname
uptime
ans: The exit status of a shell script is the exit status of the last command executed in the shell script. To override this behavior, use the exit command followed by the desired exit status. All scripts and command have an exit status. Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255.

9. If you want to specify exit status of a shell script, what command should you use?
ans: The "return" command returns from a shell function. The "exit" command allows you to specify an exit status. Example: "exit 1". The remaining commands of "back" and "status" are not shell built-in commands.
